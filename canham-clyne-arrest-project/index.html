Arrest Data
</p>
<br>
<p class="chapter-text">In 2013 the University of Maryland Police Department’s jurisdiction expanded to include most of the city of College Park.
</p>
<br>
<p class="info-header">Arrests by Year 2013-2018</p>
 <div id="myLineChart"></div>
<br>
<p class="chapter-text">Since then UMPD has arrested at least 3,549 people. At least 48% of the people they arrested were black. This data was collected from publicly available records on the UMPD website and then sorted to remove cases where individuals were arrested one time but charged with multiple crimes, or cases where one person was arrested for crimes committed multiple incidents on different dates.
</p><br>
<p class="info-header">Racial distribution of arrests, according to UMPD data</p>

  <div id="racedistributionchart"></div>

  <p class="chapter-text">About eight percent of the time, UMPD did not record a race when making arrests. This accounts for about 267 arrests, but 192 of those were concentrated in just a couple years.</p>
  <br>

  <p class="chapter-text"> According to Forbes Magazine’s 2019 College Rankings, UMD’s student population is about 13% black or African American. City-Data.com, meanwhile, claimed that in 2017 College Park was about 18% black and 13% Hispanic. City Data claims that in 2017 College Park’s population was 47.7% white, while Forbes reported that UMD’s student population was 50.2% white. </p>
<br>
  <p class="chapter-headline">
  What is an arrest?
  </p>

  <p class="chapter-text">According to Sergeant Roseanne Hoaas, the Public Information Officer for UMPD, arrests don’t necessarily mean the police handcuff someone and take them to a holding cell, although that does happen. Hoaas said UMPD officers have wide discretion when making arrests,  that some arrests are filed well after events and calls, in the form of criminal summonses.
    </p>
  <br>
  <p class="chapter-text">Hoaas said UMPD counts criminal citations and even some civil citations in its arrest data. Criminal citations, according to Hoaas, are citations given by officers that result in a later court date for a criminal offense, while civil citations include some alcohol and marijuana offenses.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p class="chapter-text">Elonna Jones, 21, a senior at the University of Maryland College Park and president of the school’s branch of the NAACP, said the arrest statistics were jarring, but not surprising. Jones said the disparities in arrests show that racial bias is inextricably linked to arrests.
  </p>

  <p class="chapter-text"> [paragraph about arrests marked Suspicion, No Charges]
  </p>

<p class="chapter-headline">UMPD and the students
</p>
<br>
<p class="chapter-text"> Jones also noted that first-year black enrollment at UMD has fallen recently, a trend she attributed to Wallace Loh’s presidency, in particular, his response to the murder of 2nd lieutenant Richard Collins III.
</p>
<br>
<p class="chapter-text"> Collins, a black student from Bowie State University, was murdered days before his graduation in May 2017. Sean Urbanski, a former UMD student, was charged with Collins’ murder and with hate crimes, according to the Diamondback.
</p>
<br>
<p class="chapter-text"> According to Jones, the bus stop where Collins was murdered has [confirm the exact quotes with recording]. Jones said many black students do not feel safe on campus, and that this feeling is exacerbated by the Administration’s lack of transparency.
</p>
<br>
<p class="chapter-text"> Hoaas, meanwhile, said that UMPD tries to perform community outreach. Hoaas claims the department sends officers to events where their presence is requested, as a way to provide security. UMPD also runs a police auxiliary program, which enlists students to assist in public safety work. Hoaas said the auxiliary program, and other community outreach efforts are part of an ongoing effort by UMPD to be seen well.
